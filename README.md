# Unsplashify Terminal

### This beautiful npm package was developed by Leonardo Nerone(LeoNero) and Thor Garcia(Thor99). Its purpose is to set your wallpaper picture (only using the id of an Unsplash photo) through the terminal. 

P.S: only works with Linux, because the developers of this package are dumb (or lazy :D)

## Installation and usage
``` npm install -g  unsplashify-terminal ```

* First, get an id from: https://unsplash.com/
* Example: https://unsplash.com/?photo=cfyTzECvjlU
* The id is cfyTzECvjlU

```
sudo unsplashify cfyTzECvjlU

Enjoy your new wallpaper! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
